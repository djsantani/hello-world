# hello-world

Hi Humans!

So this is me learning about the how git actually works. I was asked to use github for a NginX project at work and I had no clue on how to actually use github and what is used for. I am also taking advantage of this so that I can practice the way I type now days. I've changed the way I type so, it would take some practice to get used to. But I'm getting there soon enough. Hopefully I can type so much faster after practicing here at github.
